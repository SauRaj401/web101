My first responsive webdesign using html and css only.
It has simple UI/UX design with 4 nav bar.
I have use 2 section of width and height in home page. (70% for left and 28% for right side.)
There is post id inside col-7 id which contain different bg color so that there is ceratin gap in each post id to make page beautiful.
In Ingredients tab there is images im manages asy using grid based layout. Images are kept using img tag.
In this way all pages is well manage.
It is mobile friendly webpages so it gives good output in mobile devices.
