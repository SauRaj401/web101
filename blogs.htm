			It's true: Homemade noodles take more time to prepare than store-bought. 
			But they reward cooks (and their lucky guests) with fresher, richer,
			better-tasting noodles to serve with all kinds of dishes—pot roast, beef stroganoff, homemade beef and noodles, homemade .
			3chicken noodles, Swedish meatballs, braised meats, casseroles, and more. In fact, once you learn how to make noodles,
			you'll find all kinds of satisfying ways to enjoy them!

			<h1>Homemade American Noodles vs. Other Pastas</h1>

			Noodles come to the table in many countries around the world, 
			like cellophane noodles in China, soba noodles in Japan, 
			and the scores of pasta types and shapes available in Italy. 
			What makes North American noodles (found in or served with classic comfort foods like chicken noodles) 
			different than most other noodles is that they are often enriched with egg or egg yolks.
			They can be cut long or short, thick or thin, but—thanks to the egg quotient—they're among the richest noodles around.
